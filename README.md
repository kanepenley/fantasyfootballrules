# Rules
### Logistics
- League announcements and coordination will occur in the league's Discord. Members are responsible for following the announcements channel for updates.
- Changes to league rules are made by a vote in the Discord server, requiring a simple vote of yes vs no. All votes must be live for at least 24 hours, with more time allowed at commissioner discretion depending on the significance of the rule change and the # of polls live at the same time.
- Rules should be documented on this page by the commissioner and updated any time there is a change.
### Offseason
The league has a buy-in of $30. A buy-in is considered notice to the commissioner that a member plans on playing the upcoming season. The buy-ins are due before the draft, or else members are at risk of removal from the league. If someone has special circumstances making the payment by draft date difficult, they should reach out to the commissioner to work it out in advance.

### Prizes
The pool of buy-in money pays out to the top 3 as follows:
- 1st Place - $300
- 2nd Place - $90
- 3rd Place - $30

In addition to the payout, the champion will have their name engraved on the league's trophy, and it will stay with the winner throughout the following season. At the end of that season, their name will be engraved on the trophy and sent to the new champion.

### Last Place
Before the start of each season, the commissioner will facilitate a vote to settle on a list of 3 options for a last-place punishment. Last place is defined by the person in last at the end of the regular season (excludes playoffs). The punishment must be adhered to and done by the start of the following season. Failure to comply will result in expulsion from the league.
